### ## üìù Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for building a binary classification model. The goal is to predict whether an iris flower is of the **Iris virginica** species based on its sepal and petal measurements.

The project covers all key stages from data exploration and visualization to model training and performance evaluation.

### ## üå∏ Dataset

The project uses the classic **Iris dataset**, a well-known dataset in pattern recognition and machine learning.

* **Source:** Scikit-learn's built-in datasets (originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository).
* **Features:**
    1.  Sepal Length (cm)
    2.  Sepal Width (cm)
    3.  Petal Length (cm)
    4.  Petal Width (cm)
* **Target:** Three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
* **Samples:** 150 total (50 for each species).

### ## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

The analysis is structured in a Jupyter Notebook (`iris_classification.ipynb`) and follows these steps:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
    * Checked for missing values, data types, and statistical properties.
    * Analyzed the class distribution to confirm the dataset is balanced.

2.  **Data Visualization:**
    * Created a **pair plot** to visualize relationships between all features, colored by species.
    * Generated a **correlation heatmap** to identify multicollinearity between features.
    * Used **box plots** to compare the feature distributions for each species.

3.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Converted the multi-class problem into a binary one (Virginica vs. Not Virginica).
    * Split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing.
    * Scaled the features using `StandardScaler` to normalize their range.

4.  **Model Training & Evaluation:**
    * Trained a **Logistic Regression** model on the preprocessed training data.
    * Evaluated the model's performance on the unseen test set using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.

### ## üìä Model Performance

The trained Logistic Regression model demonstrated excellent performance on the held-out test set.

* **Accuracy:** **100%**

* **Confusion Matrix:** The matrix confirms that there were zero misclassifications.
    * **True Negatives (Not Virginica):** 20
    * **True Positives (Virginica):** 10
    * **False Positives / Negatives:** 0

    

* **Classification Report:**
    | Class         | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
    | :------------ | :-------- | :----- | :------- |
    | Not Virginica | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     |
    | Virginica     | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     |
